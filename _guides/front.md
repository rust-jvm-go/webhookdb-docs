# Front (via Apps install)

To sync Front to WebhookDB, go to <https://api.webhookdb.com/v1/install/front> and follow the prompts to connect your accounts.

Once you have connected to WebhookDB, we will immediately start listening for changes and updates on your Conversations and Messages. There is no further set up required.

To access your database, use the database string provided to you on successful signup:

<img src="/assets/images/front-oauth-success-screenshot.png" style="width: calc(100% - 1rem); margin-top: 1rem; margin-left: 0.5rem; margin-right: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; height: auto;"></img>

If for some reason you lose that string, you can use our CLI either by downloading it or heading to our website for [the online version](https://webhookdb.com/terminal).

It is very important that you use the email you provided during the signup flow to login to your WebhookDB account. Once logged in, run `webhookdb db connection` to retrieve your connection string.

```
$ webhookdb auth login --username=hello@webhookdb.com
$ webhookdb db connection 
postgres://aro55a1841c055f2527e92:55a37f543dca21a2dc4@hello_webhookdb_com_org.db.webhookdb.com:5432/adb45a07a3bb140afb172a
```
